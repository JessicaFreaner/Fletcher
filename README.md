Fourth project within the Metis Bootcamp. The goal was to use Natural Language Processing on data of our choosing. My choice was the online charity [DonorsChoose.Org](http://data.donorschoose.org/). They are a crowdfunding site aimed at provide desperately needed resources for children in classrooms across the United States. Teachers make submissions and propose projects in need of funding. Visitors to the site choose which projects to help fund.

Analysis utilized NTLK to parse and analyse essay submissions by teachers. Goal was to identify asks by need groups and type of asks per need group.
